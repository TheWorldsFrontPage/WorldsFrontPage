# FAQ

## What was your motivation?

Me and some friends decided to create an interactive website that would offer the latest news on world and local politics, and with much more features.

## How will it make money?

Right now, there are no disclosed ideas about how it will make money.

## Will open source contributors get paid?

In the future, maybe.

## Why should I use it?

You should use our website because we take things to the next step. Nowadays, looking through a news website can be boring. We strive to make
it interactive, by adding quizzes, cool history moments, and even a currency system that will be later implemented, where you can spend
the currency to get other prizes within our website!
